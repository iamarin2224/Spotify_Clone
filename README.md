## 🙈 .gitignore Details

The `.gitignore` file is intentionally included in the repository to specify untracked files and directories. It contains entries to exclude:

- `assets/` – Directory containing audio files and images.  
- `songs.json` – JSON file with song metadata.  

This practice ensures that large media files are not uploaded to the repository, keeping it lightweight and focused on code.
